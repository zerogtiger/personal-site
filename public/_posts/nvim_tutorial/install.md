# Pre-requisites

## Goal of this article

This articles covers the steps to install the Neovim, which will serve as the basis of our editor to be configured.

## Installation

### macOS

If you're on macOS, simply run `brew install neovim`, which will download all necessary files and add the neovim executable to your `$PATH` variable. 

To update Neovim, run `brew update`, which will update Neovim, Homebrew, and all other packages installed with Homebrew. 

To upgrade Neovim, run `brew upgrade Neovim`, which will update Neovim to the newest stable release version on your machine. 

### Linux

<summary>There's a difference between update and upgrade?</summary>

Although almost always used interchangeably, "update" and "upgrade" have distinct, though similar meanings in the software realm. 

Both refer to downloading and replacing a older version of a particular piece of software with a newer version. 

However, update only "enhances" software, meaning they don't provide new features and only fixes problems instead.

Upgrade, on the otherhand, often brings new features and other significant changes. 

As an analogy, consider an old, framed painting. An update would be equivalent to replacing the paint-stripping wood with new ones, whereas an upgrade would be equivalent to replacing the current painting with the original Mona Lisa.
